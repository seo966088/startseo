# StartSEO Backlink Maker

StartSEO Backlink Maker is a tool that automates the process of creating backlinks for a given domain on specified websites.

## Features

- **Automated Backlink Creation:** Create backlinks for a specific domain on multiple websites automatically.
- **Custom Time Interval:** Set a time interval between backlink creation attempts to avoid overwhelming target websites.
